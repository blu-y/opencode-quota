// OpenCode's plugin loader iterates over all exports and calls them as functions
export { QuotaToastPlugin } from "./plugin.js";

// Re-export types for consumers (types are erased at runtime, so safe to export)
export type {

// NOTE: tool exports are part of the plugin runtime contract and are not
// exported from the package entrypoint.

// NOTE: DEFAULT_CONFIG is NOT exported here because OpenCode's plugin loader
// would try to call it as a function. Import from "./lib/types.js" directly if needed.
